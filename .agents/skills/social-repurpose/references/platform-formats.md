# Platform Formats Reference

Quick reference for platform-specific constraints, best practices, and formatting rules used by the social-repurpose skill.

---

## LinkedIn

### Constraints
| Field | Limit |
|---|---|
| Post text | 3,000 characters max (aim for 900-1,300) |
| "See more" fold | ~210 characters before truncation |
| Hashtags | 3-5 per post (more hurts reach) |
| Images | 1200x627px recommended for link previews |
| Video | Up to 10 minutes, native upload preferred |

### Formatting Rules
- **Line breaks matter** — LinkedIn rewards white space. Use single blank lines between paragraphs.
- **Hook line is critical** — First 2 lines appear before "See more." Make them count.
- **No markdown** — LinkedIn doesn't render markdown. Use Unicode characters for emphasis if needed:
  - Bold: surround text with asterisks (LinkedIn renders **bold**)
  - Bullets: use `→` or `•` characters
- **Hashtags at the end** — Place hashtags on the last line, separated by spaces.
- **No links in the first comment** — Some strategies move links to the first comment to avoid algorithm penalties. Default: include link in the post body.

### Best Practices
- Posts with 1,200-1,500 characters get 2x more engagement than short posts
- Ask a question to drive comments (comments boost reach more than likes)
- Personal stories outperform corporate announcements
- First-person perspective ("I learned..." not "This article explains...")
- Avoid: "I'm excited to announce," "Thrilled to share," "Check out my latest"

### Hook Formulas
1. **Contrarian:** "Everyone says [common belief]. They're wrong. Here's why:"
2. **Data-driven:** "[Specific stat] changed how I think about [topic]."
3. **Story:** "Last week, [something happened]. It taught me [lesson]."
4. **Question:** "What would you do if [scenario]?"
5. **List tease:** "After [experience], here are [N] things I wish I'd known:"

### Example Output
```
The biggest mistake SaaS companies make with pricing?

They optimize for conversion rate instead of revenue per visitor.

I've seen this pattern across dozens of companies:

→ They A/B test pricing pages obsessively
→ They find a "winner" that converts 12% better
→ Revenue actually drops because they attracted lower-value customers

The fix is simple: optimize for willingness-to-pay, not click-through.

Here's what that looks like in practice:

1. Segment by use case, not company size
2. Anchor your highest tier first
3. Make the middle tier the obvious choice

The companies doing this see 20-40% revenue lifts without changing their product.

## Twitter/X

### Constraints
| Field | Limit |
|---|---|
| Tweet | 280 characters max |
| Thread | No limit on tweets, but 3-7 is optimal |
| Hashtags | 1-2 per tweet max (more hurts engagement) |
| Links | Count as 23 characters regardless of length |
| Images | Up to 4 per tweet, 5MB max each |
| Polls | Up to 4 options, 25 characters each |

### Formatting Rules
- **Thread numbering:** Use `1/` or `1/7` format at the start of each tweet
- **No tweet should depend on the previous** — Each should make sense standalone (people see individual tweets in feeds)
- **Hook tweet has no number** — Some strategies skip numbering on tweet 1 to make it look like a standalone post
- **Final tweet:** CTA + link + optional hashtags
- **Whitespace:** Use line breaks within tweets for readability

### Best Practices
- Hook tweet gets 80% of impressions — spend most effort there
- Threads with 5-7 tweets get highest engagement
- Use specific numbers over vague claims ("increased revenue 34%" not "grew revenue significantly")
- Quote-tweet your own hook tweet with a summary to re-share the thread
- Reply to your thread with the link (keeps the hook tweet clean)
- Avoid: threads that could be a single tweet, excessive self-promotion

### Hook Formulas
1. **Bold claim:** "[Specific outcome] in [timeframe]. Here's the exact playbook:"
2. **List tease:** "[N] things about [topic] that most people get wrong:"
3. **Observation:** "I've noticed [pattern]. Here's what's actually happening:"
4. **Challenge:** "Hot take: [contrarian opinion about common practice]"
5. **Before/after:** "[Thing] was broken. Then we [change]. Results:"

### Example Output
```
1/ The #1 reason SaaS pricing pages fail:

They optimize for conversion rate instead of revenue.

A thread on what actually works 🧵

2/ Most teams run A/B tests on their pricing page.

They find a "winner" that converts 12% better.

But revenue drops. Why?

They attracted lower-value customers who churn in 60 days.

3/ The fix: optimize for willingness-to-pay.

Three tactics:

→ Segment by use case, not company size
→ Anchor your highest tier first
→ Make the middle tier the obvious choice

4/ Companies doing this see 20-40% revenue lifts.

No product changes. No new features. Just better positioning of what they already have.

## Instagram

### Constraints
| Field | Limit |
|---|---|
| Caption | 2,200 characters max |
| "More" fold | ~125 characters before truncation |
| Hashtags | 30 max per post (20-30 recommended) |
| Bio link | One link (use link-in-bio service for multiple) |
| Carousel | Up to 20 slides |

### Formatting Rules
- **Line breaks:** Instagram collapses multiple line breaks. Use a period or invisible character on empty lines to force breaks.
- **Hashtag block:** Separate hashtags from caption with 5 line breaks (dots or invisible chars). This pushes them below the fold.
- **Emojis:** Use 2-4 per paragraph. Place them at the start of bullet points or as section dividers.
- **No clickable links** — Links in captions are not clickable. Use "Link in bio" CTA.
- **Mentions:** Tag relevant accounts with @handle.

### Best Practices
- First line must hook — it appears in the feed before "...more"
- Carousel posts get 1.4x more reach than single images
- Save-worthy content (tips, frameworks, data) performs best
- Ask a question at the end to drive comments
- Mix hashtag sizes: 10 broad (500K+ posts), 10 medium (50K-500K), 10 niche (<50K)
- Post hashtags in the caption, not the first comment (algorithm change in 2024)

### Hashtag Strategy
Build three tiers:
1. **Broad (10):** High-volume, general topic hashtags (#marketing, #business, #entrepreneur)
2. **Medium (10):** Category-specific hashtags (#saasmarketing, #pricingstrategy, #b2bsales)
3. **Niche (10):** Highly targeted hashtags (#saasfounder, #pricingtips, #revenueoptimization)

### Example Output
```
Stop optimizing your pricing page for conversions. 🚫

Here's why that's costing you revenue 👇

Most SaaS teams run A/B tests on their pricing page and celebrate when conversions go up 12%.

But here's what they miss:

📉 Revenue actually drops
😤 They attract lower-value customers
💸 Churn spikes within 60 days

The real move? Optimize for willingness-to-pay.

Three things that work:

1️⃣ Segment by use case, not company size
2️⃣ Anchor your highest tier first
3️⃣ Make the middle tier the obvious choice

Companies doing this see 20-40% revenue lifts without changing their product.

## Facebook

### Constraints
| Field | Limit |
|---|---|
| Post text | 63,206 characters max |
| "See more" fold | ~477 characters before truncation |
| Hashtags | 0-2 max (hashtags hurt Facebook reach) |
| Link preview | Auto-generated from URL (title, description, image) |
| Video | Up to 240 minutes |

### Formatting Rules
- **Front-load value** — The first 477 characters appear before "See more." Put the hook and key insight there.
- **Link on its own line** — Place the article URL on its own line at the end for a clean link preview.
- **Minimal formatting** — Facebook doesn't support markdown or special characters well. Keep it conversational.
- **No hashtags** — Facebook's algorithm deprioritizes posts with hashtags. Skip them or use 1-2 max.

### Best Practices
- Questions drive 2x more comments than statements
- Native video gets 10x more reach than link posts
- Posts with 40-80 characters get highest engagement, but longer posts work for articles
- Facebook rewards posts that start conversations — end with a discussion prompt
- Tag relevant pages/people when genuine (not spam tagging)
- Avoid: excessive emojis, hashtag strings, "engagement bait" (Facebook penalizes "comment YES if...")

### Hook Formulas
1. **Question:** "Have you ever [common experience]? Here's what most people get wrong:"
2. **Surprising stat:** "We found that [counterintuitive data point]. Here's what that means:"
3. **Relatable frustration:** "You know that feeling when [pain point]? There's actually a fix."
4. **Quick tip:** "Quick tip for [audience]: [one-sentence insight]. Here's the full story:"
5. **Story opener:** "Last month we [did something]. The results surprised us."

### Example Output
```
Have you ever A/B tested your pricing page and seen conversions go up... but revenue go down?

It happens more often than you'd think.

The problem: optimizing for conversion rate attracts lower-value customers who churn fast. You end up working harder for less money.

The fix is counterintuitive — instead of making it easier to sign up, make the value clearer. Segment by use case, anchor your highest tier, and let the middle option sell itself.

Companies doing this see 20-40% revenue lifts without changing their product.

## Cross-Platform Guidelines

### Differentiation Rules
Each platform post should feel **native**, not reformatted. Key differences:

| Aspect | LinkedIn | Twitter/X | Instagram | Facebook |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Tone | Professional, insightful | Direct, punchy | Casual, visual | Conversational, personal |
| Length | Long (900-1,300 chars) | Short (280/tweet) | Medium (1,000-1,500) | Medium (500-1,000) |
| Hashtags | 3-5 | 1-2 in final tweet | 20-30 in block | 0-2 |
| Emojis | Minimal (0-2) | Moderate (1-2/tweet) | Frequent (2-4/para) | Minimal (1-2) |
| CTA style | Comment/discuss | Follow/RT | Link in bio | Click link/comment |
| Hook style | Insight/story | Bold claim/data | Visual/emotional | Question/story |
| Links | In post body | In final tweet | "Link in bio" | Own line at end |

### Content Adaptation (Not Duplication)
- **Same core message** across all platforms
- **Different framing** for each audience
- **Different hooks** — don't use the same opening line across platforms
- **Different CTAs** — match platform behavior (LinkedIn: discuss, Twitter: retweet, Instagram: save, Facebook: click)
- **Different depth** — LinkedIn goes deep, Twitter distills, Instagram visualizes, Facebook discusses
